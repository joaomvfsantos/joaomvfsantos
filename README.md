## Summary

I'm an MSc in Computer and Electronics Engineering, with 14+ years experience in architecting, managing and building mobile, web and backend applications.

I build agentic AI applications. Extensive experience in building production grade iOS applications with Swift and Objective-C. When it comes to web TypeScript and Angular is my world. I glue them together with NodeJS on the server, with MySQL and MongoDB as my persistent memory. I deploy it all using Docker.
